# Catify Project  

Welcome to **Catify**, the perfect place to find your very own kitty and learn fun facts about them! 

## Check the Code and File structure on github
   ```bash  
            https://github.com/rajpatel2435/catify  
   ```  

## Technologies Used  
- **Next.js**  
- **TypeScript** : to avoid runtime errors
- **Tailwind CSS**  

## Libraries Used  
- **Axios**: For fetching data from APIs.  

## Features  
- **Parallel API Requests**: Improved performance by running multiple API calls concurrently.  
- **Accessibility**: Added ARIA labels for screen readers to enhance usability.  

## Getting Started  
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:  

1. Clone the project:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/rajpatel2435/catify  
   ```  

2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   ```bash  
   cd catify  
   ```  

3. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   npm install  
   ```  

4. Start the development server:  
   ```bash  
   npm run dev  
   ```  

5. Visit the app in your browser at:  
   [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)  

## Deployment  
The project is deployed on Vercel and can be accessed here:  
[Catify on Vercel](https://catify-one.vercel.app/)  

## Time Spent  
Approximately **30â€“45 minutes** (including deployment to Vercel).  

## Challenges Faced  
- Initially forgot to build the project locally before deploying to Vercel.  
- Accidentally added an unused library (`axios`) in `page.tsx`.  

## Potential Future Enhancements  

### Performance Optimization
- Enable caching to store API responses and further improve performance. 
- Optmize DB Queries

### Additional Features
- Post your own kitty along with Facts (CRUD operation in API)
- We can build User Authentication
- After login, they can also save their own kitty (Adding like functionality)
- Share with your friends (User Engagements for website traffic)
- Fetch similar breeds of cats and provide related facts.  
- Categorize cats into different groups for easier exploration.   

### SEO 
- Implement more tags for seo related such as opengraph, data, schema and more

## Feedback

### Good things
- Clear project scope and requirements 
- Defined specific tasks
- Flexibility on coding languange


### improvement
- bit confused for allow users to fetch cat image and facts (with one single button or 2 button) (Implemenetd only one button to do one task)
- I can also make sperate button for that (Logic is there if we need)
- will be more good if you can provide sample design
